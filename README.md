Hi! I'm Korede, a recent grad with a degree in Molecular Science and Software Engineering. I have a unique blend of scientific knowledge and computational skills. I am seeking a full-time role in biotech or pharmaceutical companies. In the meantime, I am working exploring different programs and packages built for machine learning for life sciences.
