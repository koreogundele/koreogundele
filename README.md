Hello! Iâ€™m Korede, a soon-to-be graduate in Molecular Science and Software Engineering with 3 years of molecular biology experience. I'm eager to apply my combined experience in machine learning and data science to accelerate innovation within the molecular sciences. I am actively seeking roles where I can leverage my academic foundation and practical experience to contribute to meaningful research and development.
